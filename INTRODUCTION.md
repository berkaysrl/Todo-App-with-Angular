# TODO App - ICRON Assignment - Cevdet Berkay Sarialioglu

I'm delighted to present my completed Full-Stack Developer Internship assignment, a comprehensive Todo Application implemented with Angular. This assignment has not only provided me a chance to enhance my Angular knowledge but also has served as a practical introduction to the usage of Reactive Programming, RxJS, and CRUD operations.

The application consists of two core pages: category management and Todo item management. In the category management page, users can create, edit, and remove categories. On the Todo item management page, users can add, edit, and remove Todo items associated with specific categories. This page also includes functionality for filtering by category and text search.

My focus was on creating a reactive and user-friendly application. I used Lazy Loading for page routing to enhance the app's performance. The data for categories and Todo items are stored in local storage to ensure persistence even when the browser is closed and reopened. Communication with single-instance injectable service functions and data synchronization with Behavior Subjects and observable lists is how data communication is maintained.

I made extensive use of Angular's Reactive Forms to manage the addition of categories and Todo items, including the ability to enable the 'add' button only when inputs are correctly filled. The Todo list is also structured as a collection of Reactive Form groups.

As for the aesthetics, the application is styled with Bootstrap 5, employing the flex structure for layout and appropriate Bootstrap classes for inputs and tables. In terms of CSS, I've used SCSS standards and maintained a uniform visual theme through the use of variables.

This project has been an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of Angular, RxJS, and full-stack development best practices. I look forward to tackling more complex challenges and continually improving my skill set.
